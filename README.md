# md5-bmp
A simple tool to convert text into a bitmap representation of its md5 checksum.

## Example:
The following image has been generated with the string "ElectricCoffee's MD5-BMP Tool",
which generated the following checksum: `914329dd9233d2974886fe02ebc73dab`.

This checksum has then been fed into the algorithm to produce this image:
